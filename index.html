		<p>Marriage is a merger, a partnership, a coming together of two. wedding dreams generally indicate a partnership, commitment at a new level, or increased intimacy with the bridegroom Jesus.While your marriage is not a business, it is, for most of us, the greatest relationship, partnership, entity in our lives. And yet, most couples enter a marriage with no mission statement, no vision for the future -- just some ideas of what they seek from a partner and a hope for the future.
		The illustration of a great house and my dream car is one that pushes me to work hard. This is a picture of my contentment.</p>

		<p>It is my great desire to always seek God in prayer and reading the word. My life long mission is to never depart from the Lord. <em>those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength; they will fly up on wings like eagles; they will run and not be tired; they will walk and not be weary</em>. And with my whole life i want to serve people, bring them to a better life filled with the goodness of christ.</p>
